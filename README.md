# Exercise 1 Software Architecture

This exercise was an open exercise to create a game using libGDX and Kotlin.

There are here four slightly diffent games that can be run using libGDX and the command

```bash
./gradlew desktop:run
```

From each of the subproject directories (ex. exercise1-task1).
